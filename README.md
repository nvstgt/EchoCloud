# EchoCloud
An intentionally vulnerable music sharing web app. TheProfezzorJ is just looking to share his Rad SUmmer Hitz List with his students, but the website is a total mess. Multiple vulnerabilities that stack on top of each other, inappropriate security patches that don't fix the issues. Seems like they need some help from a cybersecurity professional.
