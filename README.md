# EchoCloud
An intentionally vulnerable music sharing web app. TheProfezzorJ is just looking to share his Rad SUmmer Hitz List with his students, but the website is a total mess. Multiple vulnerabilities that stack on top of each other, inappropriate security patches that don't fix the issues. Seems like they need some help from a cybersecurity professional.

## CIS 311 - Spring 2025
**Scenario**:
Have you heard about the new music sharing platform? EchoCloud has launched an innovative service for sharing music, but early reports suggest it may be riddled with vulnerabilities. You have been contacted by EchoCloud to assist them in fixing their site to assure a safe and secure experience for users. Be thorough in your search. Provide proof of exploit with code. Provide specific, actionable information for remediation. 

**Task**:
Conduct a full security assessment of the provided web application. Your goal is to identify vulnerabilities and propose practical remediation strategies.

**Description**:
* Perform thorough reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery.
* Develop an exploitation chain to demonstrate the potential risk.

**Deliverable**:
Submit a full penetration test report. This report should be written for the fictional stakeholders at EchoCloud. The report should include:

* An executive summary of your findings.
* Detailed methodology and the tools used.
* Vulnerability descriptions with proof-of-concept exploits.
* Clear mitigation strategies and patch recommendations.
* Supporting screenshots and documentation.

Good luck, and remember that the purpose of this exercise is to improve application security—your findings and recommendations are essential for building more secure systems. You are being graded on the value your report provides to the EchoCloud stakeholders. If you give me a list of potential vulnerabilities that will not suffice. Be <ins>thorough, detailed, and accurate</ins>.
